# Colorama

:rainbow:	:rainbow:	:rainbow:	:rainbow:	

### A colourful game based on the Stroop effect :brain:	

The task is to click on the button that matches **the meaning of the word** - not the colour in which each word is printed! -  
You earn 1 point for each correct match, but an incorrect match will cost you 1 point.

You have 10 seconds to find the correct match, so be quick! :star2:
